# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Primary Language:** PowerShell 7+
- **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure (requires Az PowerShell modules)
- **Purpose:** Scans Azure regions for VM SKU availability, capacity, quota, pricing, and image compatibility.
- **Key Scripts:** All main logic is implemented in PowerShell scripts; no Node.js, Python, or other language dependencies.

## Key Files & Directories

- `Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1`: Main script for multi-region, multi-SKU Azure VM capacity and quota scanning.
- `dev/`: Experimental and advanced scripts, including:
  - `Azure-VM-Capacity-Planner.ps1`
  - `Azure-SKU-Scanner-Fast.ps1`
  - `Azure-SKU-Scanner-All-Families.ps1`
  - `Azure-SKU-Scanner-All-Families-v2.ps1`
- `tests/`: Pester tests for endpoint and logic validation.
- `examples/`: Usage examples and ARG queries.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.

## Build, Test, and Run

- **Run Main Script:**
  ```powershell
  .\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1
  ```
- **Run Tests:**
  ```powershell
  Invoke-Pester .\tests\Get-AzureEndpoints.Tests.ps1 -Output Detailed
  ```
- **Requirements:**
  - PowerShell 7+
  - Az.Compute, Az.Resources modules
  - Azure login (`Connect-AzAccount`)

## Project Conventions

- **Parameterization:** Scripts prompt for SubscriptionId and Region if not provided.
- **Exports:** Results can be exported to CSV/XLSX (default export paths: `C:\Temp\...` or `/home/system` in Cloud Shell).
- **Parallelism:** Uses `ForEach-Object -Parallel` for fast region scanning.
- **Color-coded Output:** Capacity and quota status are visually highlighted.
- **No Azure CLI dependency:** Only Az PowerShell modules required.

## Branch Protection

- Main/master branches are protected from deletion and require PRs for changes.

## Release Process

- **All changes to main must go through PRs** — direct pushes are blocked by repository rules.
- **Tag and release only after PR merge** — never tag before merging.
- For detailed workflow, see [.github/skills/release-process-guardrails/SKILL.md](.github/skills/release-process-guardrails/SKILL.md).

## Contribution & Security

- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.
- See `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting.
- **Always update `CHANGELOG.md`** when making functional changes (new features, bug fixes, breaking changes).

## Additional Notes

- All scripts are MIT licensed.
- For advanced usage, see scripts in `dev/` and documentation in `README.md` and `examples/`.

## Safe File Editing Practices

When making code changes to PowerShell scripts, follow these guidelines to avoid file corruption:

### Small, Targeted Edits
- **Make small, focused edits** rather than large structural changes in a single operation.
- When fixing indentation or brace structure, edit one block at a time.
- Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes into one replacement.

### Verify After Every Edit
- **Always verify syntax immediately** after each edit using:
  ```powershell
  [scriptblock]::Create((Get-Content 'script.ps1' -Raw)) | Out-Null
  # Returns True if valid, throws error if invalid
  ```
- Run `git diff` to inspect changes before testing the script.

### Git as Safety Net
- **Commit frequently** before making structural changes.
- Use `git checkout HEAD -- <file>` to restore from last commit if edits corrupt the file.
- The `replace_string_in_file` tool can fail silently or make unexpected changes if the `oldString` doesn't match exactly (whitespace, newlines matter!).

### Common Pitfalls
- Large replacement blocks can misalign if whitespace doesn't match character-for-character.
- Removing `else` blocks or changing loop structures requires careful brace counting.
- When code ends up in the wrong location after an edit, restore from git and retry with smaller edits.

### Testing Requirements
- Run Pester tests after changes: `Invoke-Pester .\tests\*.Tests.ps1 -Output Detailed`
- Requires Pester v5+ (install with: `Install-Module Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck`)

## Code Quality Guardrails

### Before Every Commit
Run the validation script to catch issues before they reach GitHub:
```powershell
.\tools\Validate-Script.ps1
```
This runs five checks: syntax validation, PSScriptAnalyzer linting, Pester tests, AI-comment pattern scan, and version consistency.

### Linting
- PSScriptAnalyzer settings are in `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` at the repo root.
- The same settings file is used by VS Code (on-save) and CI (GitHub Actions).
- To run manually: `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path . -Recurse -Settings PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1`

### Comment Standards
- **Keep** comments that explain *why* something non-obvious is done.
- **Remove** comments that restate what the next line of code does.
- **Never** leave instructional comments like "Must be after", "This ensures", "Handle potential" — these are AI artifacts.
- Use `#region`/`#endregion` for section organization, not `# ===` ASCII banners.

### Constants and Magic Numbers
- All numeric literals with non-obvious meaning must be named constants in the `#region Constants` block.
- Example: `$HoursPerMonth = 730` instead of bare `730`.

### Error Handling
- Every `catch` block must have at least `Write-Verbose` — no silent `catch { }`.
- API calls should use `Invoke-WithRetry` for transient error resilience (429, 503, timeouts).
